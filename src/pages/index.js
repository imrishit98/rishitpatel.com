      Many other languages do not have corresponding syntax for destructuring,
      rest parameters, and spread, so these features may have a learning curve
      both for new JavaScript developers and those coming from another language.
      In this article, you will learn how to destructure objects and arrays, how
      to use the spread operator to unpack objects and arrays, and how to use
      rest parameters in function calls.
